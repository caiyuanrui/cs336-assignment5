{'response': " We'll find the multiples of 2, 3, and 5, and then subtract the numbers that are counted twice. The multiples of 2, 3, and 5 between 1 and 100 are 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 32, 35, 36, 40, 42, 45, 48, 50, 54, 60, 62, 65, 66, 70, 72, 75, 78, 80, 81, 82, 84, 85, 86, 88, 90, 92, 95, 96, 98, 99. </think> <answer> Let's count. There are 33 multiples of 2, 33 multiples of 3, and 20 multiples of 5. However, some numbers are multiples of both 2 and 3, both 2 and 5, and both 3 and 5. These numbers are counted twice. The multiples of 6 (2 and 3), 10 (2 and 5), and 15 (3 and 5) are 16, 10, and 7, respectively. The total number of multiples counted twice is 16 + 7 + 10 - 1 = 28. Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 33 + 33 + 20 - 28 = 58. The probability is 58/100 which simplifies to 29/50. <answer> Therefore, the probability that the number on the card Alexio chooses is a multiple of 2, 3 or 5 is 29/50. </answer>", 'reward': {'format_reward': 1.0, 'answer_reward': 0.0, 'reward': 0.0}}
